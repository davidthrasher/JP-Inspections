                <p id="bio">Finding that special home is a tough journey, but you don’t have to walk it alone. The property you’ve found is beautiful... but is it safe,
                  free of health hazards and energy efficient? JP Home Inspections is here to give you answers and peace of mind. Our primary
                  goal is to provide a thorough, honest and un-biased assessment of your soon to be home. Our licensed inspector, Johnathon Sanford,
                  values family and health more than anything and extends this commitment to you and yours. With his knowledge, integrity and attention
                  to detail, you can rest assured that your inspection is in good hands.</p>

                <p id="bio">JP Home Inspections is owned by Johnathon Sanford, a Georgia Conference of Home Inspectors graduate with over 10 years of experience
                    in home construction and consultation. Johnathon named JP Home Inspections after his grandparents, Jean and John Willie Prayor, as they
                    were to him, perfect examples of  love, family and values. The powerful examples they set live on through Johnathon's work, as every inspection
                    is done with care, concern and diligence.</p>
